# Snake Game

You can control the movement direction of the snake using either the mouse or keyboard. The game concludes if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. Each time the snake consumes food, it earns a point, causing its body to lengthen, and its movement speed to increase.

However, there is a maximum limit to the movement speed, preventing an infinite acceleration. The objective of the game is to attain the highest score possible.

Enjoy playing!
